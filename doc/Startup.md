# Startup 
For-profit vs non-profit startups: For-profit companies has a clear metric for measuring success and
lots of funds are available for them but in Non-profit companies it is trickier and have issue to find
money and they must be smart and creative to demonstrate impact. For-profit can show it iterative scale
through one to two years.

## SUV Visa
Advantages: Apply directly for PR outside of Canada. No minimum investment amount document.
Low language score. No geographic restriction. No mandatory requirement to be in canada. No networth.
Work permit to canada but not mandatory. No education requirements.

Disadvantages: Group activity, if someone refused the whole group refused. Lowest approval in comparison.

Support letter is just a piece of paper for IRCC and they intentionally slow the process: 1.5 to 2 years.
IRCC is the main one.
